### Overview

This package contains a set of [NestJS CLI](https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview) schematics for generating modules that can be dynamically configured.  The concepts behind the generated code is covered in detail [in this article](https://dev.to/nestjs/advanced-nestjs-how-to-build-completely-dynamic-nestjs-modules-1370)

### Installation

Install the package **globally** as shown below.  Due to the implementation of the NestJS CLI, the package **must** be global.

`npm install -g @nestjsplus/dyn-schematics`

### Dynamic Package Generation

Currently, the primary use case supported is scaffolding a *package* containing a dynamic module. Such a package can easily be installed with npm, or packaged and distributed via the [npm registry](https://npmjs.com), or a private registry.  In other words, a re-usable library.  I'm also working on versions of the schematic to
- build a dynamic module within an existing NestJS application
- adding components to a dynamic module, such as additional *options providers*

Generate a new standalone *dynamic package* that will contain the customized skeleton of a dynamic module with:

`nest g -c @nestjsplus/dyn-schematics dynpkg <pkg-name>`

- `dynpkg` is the name of the schematic to generate a standalone package containing a dynamic module.
- `<pkg-name>` is the name of the new package you're building.

Move to the sub-folder just created:

`cd <pkg-name>` where `pkg-name` is the name you supplied in the original `nest g` command above.

Install the dependencies for the generated package:

`npm install`

### Verify generated package

If you answered `yes` to the prompt`Generate a testing client?`, a small testing module was automatically generated called <project-name>ClientModule.  You can test that the template was properly generated by running

`npm run start:dev`

Then connect to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  Your browser should display `Hello from <pkg-name>Module!`.

### Customizing

The files in the project have comments that should help guide you.

You can also refer to [this article](https://dev.to/nestjs/advanced-nestjs-how-to-build-completely-dynamic-nestjs-modules-1370) for details on the concepts behind this module pattern.
